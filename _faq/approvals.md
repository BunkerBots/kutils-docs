# Why are approvals required?

We know you must be thinking, 
>*"So many approvals for just one change, why can't I just use the background  outright?!"* 

We don't blame you for thinking that, it does seem like a chore!

However, approvals are required for `2` reasons:
1. **It allows us, the staff, to check whether the backgrounds & bios are SFW (Safe for Work)** 
- If we let users use backgrounds without approval, it might work well with friendly users, but some people can abuse this freedom to use NSFW backgrounds, which is **bad**. 
- Hence, **approvals allow us to regulate the backgrounds that get used.**
2. **It allows you to save your profile in dashboard without any issues.**
- To explain this, let's take 2 cases where we use unapproved backgrounds, then try to save changes.

> 1. Case 1: Using an image outside of imgur.
> - Here, we used `https://images5.alphacoders.com/103/1034219.png` as the background for the test. You will get this result when you try to save changes:
> - ![demo21](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/906630654320595025/906631921214312478/demo21.png)
> ***
> 2. Case 2: Using an image from imgur which hasn't been approved.
> - Here, we used `https://i.imgur.com/Kuiy1BF.jpg` as the background for the test. At the time of writing, this link didn't get approved. 
> - The same result as above is seen here too when trying to save changes:
> - ![demo21](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/906630654320595025/906631921214312478/demo21.png)

As you can see, it fails to save changes in both cases.

Using approved images mitigates this issue, hence the reason we ask users to get their backgrounds approved for use.

However, using unapproved backgrounds to preview how they would look on the profile is possible, as shown [here](ku_customisation?id=a-tip-for-customisation).
