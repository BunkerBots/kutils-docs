# A Brief look at Linking

Now that you have set your bot up for use in your server, let's take a look at another feature which is important: **linking**.

## What is "linking" ?

**Linking** refers to *connecting your Krunker account with your Discord account.* It involves changing or posting something in-game, which is provided by the bot.
This is just a way to verify that the account is yours.

## Why is linking beneficial ?

Linking has some quality-of-life benefits for the user, which are:
- Checking your own profile without providing any input/arguments for profile commands.
- **Being able to customise your profile's look**

In order to use KU's customisation features, <u>linking is required.</u> Therefore, we recommend users to <u>link their Krunker account.</u> 

It's really easy and doesn't take time at all!

## How do I link my account with KU?
It's simple, just go to the channel where KU is allowed to respond and send  `k.link <username>`, where `<username>` is your **Krunker username.** After that, follow the bot's instructions.

If the Krunker account you wish to link with is under Level `10`, use `k.oldlink <username>`

## Can I link multiple accounts?
Yes, you can. You can view all the accounts linked with your Discord account using `k.accounts`
